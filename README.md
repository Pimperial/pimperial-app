## Known Issues with Dev

- **I get an error on TFS (three-finger screenshot, mostly OnePlus phones):** this is a known issue with RN upstream, here are some qf's
  - quiet the error described on this [issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/15059#issuecomment-366948308) and then restart packager (<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in expo console)
  - don't use tfs
